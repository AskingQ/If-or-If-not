# If-or-If-not

This repository contains implementations of several baseline/benchmark models as well as a newly proposed variant of TreeNets called "PossibleWorldsNet" for the purpose of result verification. For further details, please refer to https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SkZxCk-0Z: "Can Neural Networks Understand Logical Entailment" by Richard Evans, David Saxton, David Amos, Pushmeet Kohli and Edward Grefenstette.
